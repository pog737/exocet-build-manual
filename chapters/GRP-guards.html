      <p>Your wheels and tires needed to be fitted for this.</p>
      <p>Front and rear process is the same except for the Rear being even over the top of the wheel, and the front being tiled rearwards.</p>
			<p>The larger side of the guard is the INSIDE.</p>
      <ol>
  			<li>Add masking tape to the edge of the guard where you will be drilling for protection.</li>
        <li>Ensure the guard frames have sufficient clearance to the tyres. (5mm)</li>
        <li>Ensure the guard frames are parrallel.</li>
        <li>With the wheel in place rest the guard on the tire and line up the position (as above depending fr/rear)</li>
        <li>Mark the masking tape where the center of the guard frames are.</li>
        <li>Check you have marked the right side.<li>
        <li>Measure distances from holes to outer edge to verify angle.</li>
        <li>Drill a 12mm hole slightly higher on the guard; allows the wheel to be 'contained' but not too low or you cant remove the wheel!</li>
        <li>Elongate the hole with a round file to almost 24mm high, do this in small steps checking the fit as you go.</li>
        <li>When theres a good fit, tape the guard in place and test fit the wheel.</li>
        <li>Note the spacing between the mounts and the guard, preferably find some offcut to use as 'packing' this gap.</li>
        <li>Using the PU adhesive attach the guard in place.</li>
