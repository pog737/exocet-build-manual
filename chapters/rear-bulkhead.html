    <p>Another task that takes time and patience to acheive a good fit.</p>
			<ol>
  			<li>Using card cut out the profile of the outside edge using the floor as the starting point, cut small bits and get it perfect.</li>
        <li>Mark a line off the top of the card onto the chassis (white board marker)</li>
        <li>Repeat this profile cut for the otherside.</li>
        <li>Measure between the 2 marks on the chassis</li>
        <li>Lay the cad profiles on the bulk head material with the lower edge on the bottom of the material, and the 2 marks the distance apart you measured.</li>
        <li>Draw round the card profiles and discard.</li>
        <li>Create a card profile for the drivers side of the transmission tunnel</li>
        <li>We will be making 2 pieces to aid fitting. This profile should have a cut out above the top of the tunnel towards the drivers side to allow the 2nd peice to fasten to the box section.</li>
			  <li>Mark this peice as before, measure distance, place on material, draw round and discard.</li>
        <li>Repeat the profile for the passenger side. Many more angle and lines to work with here.</li>
        <li>Minimise the cut out required for the handbrake cables.</li>
        <li>The Whole piece should now be drawn, cut using a sharp knife and steel ruler.</li>
        <li>Fitting should involve bending the piece in to place.</li>
        <li>Fasten with 2.5mm drill & 3mm black screws.</li>
      </ol>
