  			<li>Add masking tape to the chassis rails where bonnet will sit for protection.</li>
  			<li>Sit bonnet in place ensuring centered and as far fowrard as possible.</li>
  			<li>Apply pressure where catches will sit and check the gaps between chassis and panel</li>
  			<li>If the gaps are uneven, mark the high bits to be removed. Remember to check that you are not going to low to impact the motor.</li>
  			<li>Remove & file the panel as marked.</li>
  			<li>Refit and repeat adjustment process until gaps are even.</li>
			<li>It may be useful to cut a small arc out of the cockpit edge of the bonnet where the chassis rails sit. this will aid with locating.</li>
  			<li>Check panel is level left to right, remove and adjust full length if required.</li>
  			<li>Fit edging strip on sides and cockpit edge of bonnet.</li>
  			<li>Mark and drill/cut holes for bonnet catches depending on the type you are using.</li>
