    <p>Much care is required here. any scratch, dust particle or finger print will be highlighted in sunlight later.</p>

  			<li>Remove the front of the cluster by applying pressure to the 10(?) clips around the edge.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the cover off, note, if you have a heated rear screen (2 wires out the back of the cluster), you will have to feed these through</li>
        <li>Remove the 2 large screws next to the main drive</li>
        <li>Remove the 2 smaller screws towards the center </li>
        <li>Remove the gauge</li>
        <li>Note where the needle sits - this will vary depending on the angle you hold the gauge so note this too.</li>
        <li>Using 2 small screw drivers leaver the needle off using the screws as pivot points.</li>
        <li>Note the angle that the display numbers of the rings sit on.</li>
        <li>Remove the 2 screws holding the face on.</li>
        <li>On the end of the main odometer, remove the tiny C clip. dont let the rings slip down.</li>
        <li>Carefully, lifting only as far as you need, starting from the small number lift and turn rings one at a time.</li>
        <li>Make sure that all the rings are sitting in the right place; applying gentle rotational pressure they shouldnt move.</li>
        <li>Re fit C clip using a magnetized screw driver to hold and another to push.</li>
        <li>Re-assemble the reverse of above.</li>
